*Notes*
1. Document Object Model === representation of the webpage as a document, with objects, which have properties and methods, 
event handlers etc. it is heierachial tree of html element objects, 

2. window is the global object. document is a subobject of the window object

3. in JS console: evaluate wndow and document to see those objects

4. console.clear()

5. as window is the global object we can access its members wthout prepending window to the window variable name.

6. we want the js to run after the dom has been created. we can do this by adding attribute "defer" in the script tag
or addng our scrpt insde the DOMContentLoaded/load event handler of the window object. preferably load.

7. Every thing that is defined with a tag like html head body various buttons, p etc are all elements in the dom,
and we can access them by getElementById, querySelector etc.

head,body,title etc which are unique in contrast to buttons, so they can be accessed by document.head and document.body.

but for buttons etc where there can be multiple such elements, we have to call the getElementById and querySelector methodsof document object to get 
ther handles. 

querySelector uses css selectors to identify the set of elenents which are filtered by the selector or have that particular type

document.all is an HTMLAllCollection=== array whose entries are the elements in js object forms. document.all[8].innerHTML += ">>>>"

similarly document.body.children[3].innerHTML = "something"


8. CSS-selectors is a complex that is made from simpler selecters. it is like a filter functon evealuated on all the 
elements in a webpage. constructing one is also a sufficently creative exercise.
